**Data modiling with postgress**

<br>
In this project is a data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python

<br>
 startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
<br><br><br><br>
They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

Create virual enviroment and run
pip install -r requariments.txt

Then we have install the PostgreSQL <br>
https://www.postgresql.org/
<br>

We coulkd  run.sql  script to create  the user student and the database studentdb.

<br>
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a 
<br>song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
<br>
The data is in the folder data
<br>
**Song Dataset**
<br>
_song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json <br>
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json_
<br>
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like. <br>

<br>
**Log Dataset**
<br>
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
<br>
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json <br>
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json<br> 
<br>
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

<br>
If you would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, you will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.
<br>
<br>

Activete the venv
and run the python create_tables.py  to create the tabe
then we can insert the data run the
 python etl.py
